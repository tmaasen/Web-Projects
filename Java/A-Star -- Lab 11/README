This projects was completed in my 2nd year of college while in data structures. This project was the capstone of our class and introduced 
us into A.I. somewhat, as this algorithm finds the shortest path possible from one end of the maze to the other.

HOW TO USE:

You can open up the test case file and run test cases against my project or simply run it from the sample mazes in Main. 

To run against the large maze images in the test package, the writeImage function (credited to Caleb Berkstresser) will save a duplicate 
image of the maze to your folder with the path the maze found in red.

This class really helped me to understand complex problems and how to apply logic to them. It was tough but rewarding as nothing that is 
rewarding in life ever comes easy!

Feedback and/or constructive criticism is always appreciated. Thank you!
