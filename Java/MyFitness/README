This projects was completed in my 1st year of college while in programming II. This project was kind of the capstone of our 

lessons in MVC design as well as basic database CRUD, working with MySQL Workbench and coding in the Eclipse IDE. Our 

instructor pretty much gave us the db schema as well as a few essential methods, and he let us go. This is probably the project I 

am most proud of in prog II as it really pushed me as a programmer, and I also really enjoy exercising and fitness so it was a 

pretty fun project. 

HOW TO USE:

The user must create an account on MyFitness Tracker before logging any exercises. Once adding an account by populating all the 

personal information fields needed, the user will have to remember their ID number to load the account. From there the user will 

be able to add, remove, or view / edit aerobic and/or strength exercises as they please.

Under preferences, the user has the option to toggle a dark mode.

If the user is finished with the program and never plans to user MyFitness Tracker again, the user should load his/her account and 

delete it from the database. All information tied to this user's account will be removed.

Feedback and/or constructive criticism is always appreciated. Thank you!
